Image classification is playing a big part in most industries today. It is going to be one of the
fundamental applications of artificial intelligence in the upcoming decades. The agenda for this
field is to enable machines to view the world as humans do, perceive it in a similar manner and
even use the knowledge for a multitude of tasks such as Image & Video recognition, Image
Analysis & Classification, Media Recreation, Recommendation Systems, Natural Language
Processing, etc. The advancements in Computer Vision with Deep Learning has been
constructed and perfected with time, primarily over one particular algorithm known as a
convolutional neural network. In this project we use artificial neural networks as classifiers to
classify theimages into 10 sets of images.The dataset taken is that of fashion MNIST dataset.
For these purposes a total of 60000 images have been used for training the neural network and
the rest of 10000 are used for testing. 

The major problem as tackled by this project is that of
neural network time issues and hyperparameter optimization. Hence, herein we use in this
project we implement a convulutional neural network using built in python libraries to classify
the fashion MNIST dataset and later we compare it with a pruned artificial neural networks.
We use different techniques of artificial neural network pruning techniques to create and test
the data precision and accuracy.The testing is to see whether of not a smaller neural network
can actually increase the dataset accuracy in a less memory and time consumption way.
